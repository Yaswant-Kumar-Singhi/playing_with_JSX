/*
Why are we importing React and what is the use of importing React
-> 
React using JSX which is not a pure JS and browser understands regular JS.
So these JSX expressions needs to transpiled into regular js syntax so that
browser can understand.

If you try to remove react import then you will face an error ---> 

---- REACT MUST BE IN SCOPE WHILLE USING JSX-----

That is why we are importing react.
